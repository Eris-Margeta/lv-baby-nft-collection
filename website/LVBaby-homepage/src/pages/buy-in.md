You can buy an LV Baby NFT depending on your ambitions
<br><br>
Each LV Baby has a special tier and a role. Some roles come with real-world capabilities and leave the project open to financial manipulation, hostile takeovers, independent decisions, drama, and more...
<br><br>

You can buy-in to some of the tiers, while some are off-limits and can only be earned (nepotism).
