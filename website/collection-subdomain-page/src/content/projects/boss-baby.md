LV Baby Collection owner - The Boss Baby.



There is only one Boss Baby. Boss Baby NFT can only be bought for a fixed $1 million price (subject to increase depending on the project-phase). Boss Baby instantly takes over the control of the ENTIRE project, all communities, and all the power in the project.

The Boss Baby can:<br>
- hire new people in the manager position of which there are only 100 available. The managers will earn % of trading royalties forever.
- earn 50% of all trading royalties and direct the money to the organisation of world-wide events or keep it all for himself
- deploy CAPITAL PUNSHIMENT. That means permanently BURN the NFT of any member at will. This does not apply to the CEO positions
- conduct interviews with potential NFT holders to decide who gets to enter the community and buy the NFT
